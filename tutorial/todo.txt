NEXT PARTS:
 * different sizes of slides
 * responsive (noting that you still need to declare widths/heights)
 * using callbacks (to implement thumbnail <img> tags for pagination? To make caption "pop up" (and down) when slide transitions)
 * mention all the other js options?
 
WHEN DONE:
 * update readme / docs
 * somewhere note that slides need solid bg color or bg image for fade effect (transparent bgs will make fade look bad)
 * PUT ALL THE CODE **IN** THE TUTORIAL (down at the bottom? or inline with the explanations?)
